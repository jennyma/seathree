use hstore to map twitter account -> last sync and twitter account ->
last request and twitter account -> tweets (array). store at most X tweets?

front end polls every x seconds with a list of followings

single exposed url: get-tweets <usernames>

to fulfill the request:
 - pull all tweets from hstore and send them.
 - if hstore is empty or last-sync is beyond acceptable, fulfill
 request as empty (ie don't hang) but spawn a thread to refill hstore
